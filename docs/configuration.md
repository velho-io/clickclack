# Configuration

`clickclack serve` resolves config in this order. Later sources override
earlier ones for any given key:

1. Hard-coded defaults (`Addr=":8080"`, `Data="./data"`).
2. JSON config file passed via `--config`.
3. Environment variables.
4. CLI flags that were explicitly set.

An explicitly present `dev_bootstrap` value in the config file is the one
exception: it is not replaced by `CLICKCLACK_DEV_BOOTSTRAP`. This prevents a
stale process environment from silently enabling development authentication
against a deployment file that explicitly disables it.

Source: `apps/api/internal/config/config.go` and the `applyFlagOverrides`
hook in `cmd/clickclack/main.go`.

## Config file

```jsonc
{
  "addr": ":8080",
  "data": "./data",
  "db": "sqlite:///var/lib/clickclack/clickclack.db",
  "uploads": "file:///var/lib/clickclack/uploads",
  "environment": "staging",
  "metrics_enabled": false,
  "dev_bootstrap": false,
  "password_auth_enabled": false,
  "public_url": "https://chat.example.com",
  "public_api_url": "https://api.example.com/services/clickclack",
  "home_url": "/portal",
  "home_label": "Portal",
  "embed_frame_ancestors": ["https://control.example.com"],
  "access_team_domain": "https://openclaw.cloudflareaccess.com",
  "access_aud": "<application-audience-tag>",
  "cookie_namespace": "production",
  "github_client_id": "Iv1.xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "github_client_secret": "...",
  "github_allowed_org": "openclaw",
  "github_moderator_org": "openclaw",
  "pushover_api_token": "azGDORePK8gMaC0QOYAMyEEuzJnyUi",
  "pushover_api_url": "https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json",
  "r2_account_id": "91b59577e757131d68d55a471fe32aca",
  "r2_access_key_id": "...",
  "r2_secret_access_key": "..."
}
```

Pass with `--config /etc/clickclack/config.json`. Values from the file
are overridden by environment variables; CLI flags override both when
explicitly set. The `dev_bootstrap` exception is described above.

The Access team domain is an HTTPS origin without credentials, a path, query,
or fragment. `access_team_domain` and `access_aud` are an all-or-nothing pair;
when both are absent, trusted-proxy authentication is disabled. See
[Trusted proxy (Cloudflare Access)](features/auth.md#trusted-proxy-cloudflare-access)
for verification, provisioning, and session behavior.

## Public frontend and API URLs

`CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_URL` is an origin, not an application base path. It must:

- use HTTPS for every non-loopback host
- contain a host and optional non-default port
- contain no credentials, path, query, fragment, or trailing-dot hostname

For example, `https://chat.example.com` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080` are valid.
`http://chat.example.com`, `https://chat.example.com/clickclack`, and
`https://user@chat.example.com` fail startup validation. GitHub OAuth
credentials also fail startup validation unless the public URL is set.

`CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_API_URL` is the canonical address browsers and installers
use for API calls. It defaults to `CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_URL`, so existing
same-origin deployments require no change. Set it only when the API has a
different public origin or a public base path:

```sh
CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_URL=https://chat.example.com
CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com/services/clickclack
```

The API URL follows the same scheme, host, credential, query, and fragment
rules. It may additionally contain a normalized base path made from ordinary
URL path segments; trailing slashes are removed. Dot segments, doubled
slashes, encoded separators, whitespace, and backslashes fail startup
validation. A path-mounted ingress must route
`/services/clickclack/api/*` to the Go server's `/api/*` routes by stripping
the configured prefix.

Loopback split origins must both use HTTP and exactly the same hostname; only
their ports may differ. This keeps local session cookies same-site. Remote
origins must use HTTPS.

When both URLs are configured, ClickClack injects the canonical API base into
the SPA HTML it serves. A separate frontend ingress should proxy the SPA and
asset routes to the ClickClack server while browsers call the configured API
origin directly. A separately hosted static build must inject the equivalent
value before the app modules run:

```html
<script>window.__CLICKCLACK_CONFIG__ = { apiBaseUrl: "https://api.example.com/services/clickclack" };</script>
```

That value is browser routing only. The server remains authoritative for setup
claim URLs and returns only URLs derived from validated administrator
configuration.

## Workspace home link

Set `CLICKCLACK_HOME_URL` and `CLICKCLACK_HOME_LABEL` (or `home_url` and
`home_label` in the JSON file) when the workspace rail's home button should
return to a surrounding product. They are independent: an unset or empty URL
defaults to `/`, and an unset or empty label defaults to `cc`, which the app
renders as the ClickClack Keystroke logo mark; any other label renders as text
on the button. Ordinary spaces around values are trimmed. Environment values
override the file as usual.

The destination must be an absolute HTTP(S) URL without credentials or a path
starting with a single `/`, such as `/portal?from=chat#latest`. Paths resolve
on the frontend origin, even when the API is hosted separately. Protocol-relative
URLs (`//host`), backslashes, and control characters are rejected at startup;
explicit HTTP(S) destinations may point to another origin.

Labels may contain up to 32 Unicode code points. Long labels are truncated in
the 48-pixel badge, while the tooltip and accessible name retain the full label.
The public `GET /api/home-link` endpoint returns only `{ "url": "/", "label": "cc" }`
by default, with either value replaced when configured. Do not put private
information in these deployment settings.

The shell reads the endpoint once at startup. Changing settings requires a
server restart and a page reload. A newer web shell connected to an older server
without the endpoint retains the built-in defaults. With integrated desktop
chrome, the default `/` destination stays inside the app as `/app`, even when
only the label changes. Other non-app destinations use the desktop shell's
existing system-browser navigation behavior.

## Cookie namespace

The default cookie names remain `cc_session` and `cc_oauth_binding`. Set
`CLICKCLACK_COOKIE_NAMESPACE` only when multiple trusted ClickClack instances
must share one hostname:

```sh
CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_URL=https://chat.example.com:8443
CLICKCLACK_COOKIE_NAMESPACE=production
```

The namespace must be at most 32 characters and contain lowercase letters,
digits, and interior hyphens. HTTPS deployments receive `__Host-` cookie names,
such as `__Host-cc-production-session`; path-mounted APIs use the path-compatible
`__Secure-` prefix and scope cookies to the configured API base path. Loopback HTTP uses
`cc-production-session`.

Treat the namespace as durable deployment identity:

- Every replica serving the same public origin and database must use the same
  namespace.
- Different instances on the same hostname must use different namespaces.
- Changing it signs browsers out and strands in-progress OAuth browser state
  until that state expires.

Cookies are scoped to hostnames, not ports. Namespaces prevent accidental
same-name collisions; they are not a security boundary between mutually
untrusted services. Put untrusted instances on separate hostnames. Use separate
registrable domains when compromise of one deployment must not affect another.

## DB URL

SQLite forms:

```
sqlite://./data/clickclack.db
./data/clickclack.db
```

Both end up at the same place — the `sqlite://` prefix is stripped. The
parent directory is created on open.

Postgres forms:

```
postgres://user:pass@host:5432/clickclack?sslmode=require
postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/clickclack?sslmode=require
```

`serve`, `migrate`, and admin commands all accept `--db` or
`CLICKCLACK_DB`. Postgres stores durable chat state in the external database.

## Upload storage

Local disk is the default:

```sh
CLICKCLACK_UPLOADS=file:///var/lib/clickclack/uploads
```

Cloudflare R2 uses the S3-compatible API:

```sh
CLICKCLACK_UPLOADS=r2://clickclack-uploads/prod
CLICKCLACK_R2_ACCOUNT_ID=91b59577e757131d68d55a471fe32aca
CLICKCLACK_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
CLICKCLACK_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

The database still stores upload metadata and auth visibility. The upload
backend stores the bytes and streams them back through `/api/uploads/{id}` after
the normal ClickClack permission checks.

## Disabling dev fallbacks

For non-local deployments:

```sh
clickclack serve \
  --dev-bootstrap=false \
  --config /etc/clickclack/config.json
```

Combine with real auth (CLI-created magic links or GitHub OAuth) so the
"first-user-in-DB" dev auth fallback never kicks in. In containers, this is
already the default; `CLICKCLACK_DEV_BOOTSTRAP=false` is only an explicit guard.
